Stimuli generating scripts, stimuli used in Experiments 1, 3, and 4, and data collection scripts for Experiment 2.
Requires MATLAB and Psychtoolbox (for Experiment 2 only).

Data for all experiments cin DataForGitHub.xlsx

## Experiment 1: Impact of Amplitude Modulation on Auditory Discomfort
Stimuli generated using the first third of the code contained in AM_FMstimuli.m

Sounds used in Qualtrics for study contained in AM_Tones.zip

## Experiment 2: Impact of Amplitude Modulation on Discomfort When Accounting for Volume
Stimuli generated during data collection. To gain volume measures for each tone for each participant, the MatchPitchVol.m script was used. The output volume measures from this script were inputted to the AMdisc.m script to collect ratings of discomfort from the loudness-matched sounds. All responses are recorded in a simple text file and in an Excel spreadsheet that is easier to use in the final analysis.

## Experiment 3: Impact of Number of Frequency Modulation Sweeps on Auditory Discomfort
Stimuli generated using the second third of the code contained in AM_FMstimuli.m

Sounds used in Qualtrics for study contained in FM1_Sounds.zip

## Experiment 4: Impact of Range of Frequencies and Central Frequency from FM Sweeps on Discomfort
Stimuli generated using the last third of the code contained in AM_FMstimuli.m

Sounds used in Qualtrics for study contained in FM2_Sounds.zip
